This is a normal tenet of a constitutional democracy and a perfectly acceptable practice in a country founded on the rule of law.We have checks and balances in place to ensure that every aspect of governance is able to withstand constitutional scrutiny.
Where we are found wanting, we will be held to account by our courts and, above all, by our citizens.
Be-sides our courts, our Chapter 9 institutions exist to advance the rights of citizens, as do the bod-ies tasked with oversight over the law enforcement agencies.As I told the journalist, every South African has a right to ap-proach the courts and even I, as President, could never stand in the way of anybody exercising that right.There has been, and will con-tinue to be, robust and strident critique of a number of aspects of our national response to coronavirus, from the data modelling and projections, to the economic effects of the lockdown, to the regulations.
As government we have nei-ther called for such critique to be tempered or for it to be silenced.To the contrary, criticism, where it is constructive, helps us to adapt and to move with agility in response to changing circumstances and conditions.
It enriches public debate and gives us all a broader under-standing of the issues at play.We have consistently main-tained that we rely on scientific, economic and empirical data when it comes to making deci-sions and formulating regula-tions around our coronavirus response.
To the greatest extent possible under these challeng-ing circumstances, we aim for consultation and engagement.
We want all South Africans to be part of this national effort.
The voices of ordinary citizens must continue to be heard at a time as critical as this.The coronavirus pandemic and the measures we have taken to combat it have taken a heavy toll on our people.
It has caused huge disruption and hardship.
Although we can point to the progress we have made in delaying the transmis-sion of the virus, there is still a long way to go.
The weeks and months ahead will be difficult and will demand much more from our people.The pandemic will therefore continue to place an enormous strain on our society and our institutions.
Even as we grad-ually open up the economy, the impact on people’s material conditions will be severe.
For as long as this is the case, the po-tential for conflict, discord and dissatisfaction will remain.As we navigate these turbu lent waters, our Constitution is our most important guide and our most valued protection.
Our robust democracy provides the strength and the resilience we need to overcome this deep crisis.Just as government appreciates that most court appli cants are motivated by the common good, so too should we recognise that the decisions taken by government are made in good faith and are meant to advance, and not to harm, the interests of South Africans.Our foremost priority remains to save lives.
Our every decision is informed by the need to advance the rights to life and dignity as set out in our Constitution.We will continue to welcome different – even dissenting – viewpoints around our na-tional coronavirus response.
All viewpoints aid us and help us to work better and smarter.The exercise of the fun-damental freedoms of expression, associa-tion and speech is a barometer of the good health of our democ-racy.
But much more than that, these rights are essential to the success of our na-tional and collective struggle to overcome the coronavirus.
Managing COVID-19: At home and at a dedicated facility
Allison Cooper
If you are not able to self-isolate, call the National Coronavirus Hotline at 0800 029 999 for more information about your closest isolation or quarantine facility.IT’S EXTREMELY important to separate yourself from others, either at home or at a free isolation facility, if you have tested positive for COVID-19.
Many South Af ricans who test positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot self-isolate because their home is too small for them to live and sleep in a room that’s not shared by anyone else.Government has ensured that dedicated isolation facilities are available for people who have tested positive, and dedicated quarantine facilities are available for people who are still waiting for their test results.
Both services are free.According to Dr Marlin McCay, a general practitioner based in Florida on the West Rand, the first thing you need to do when diagnosed with COVID-19 is to limit the spread of the infection.
“You want to protect your family,” he says.
To do this, you need to go into isolation – either at home or at an isolation facility.
“If you are self-isolating it means you have to find a part of the house where you are totally cut off from the rest of the family.
No one should come within three metres of you.
You must eat on your own; use your own cutlery and crockery; use your own bathroom, if possible; and make sure there’s no contact with anyone else in the family.“Your doctor or primary care giver should help you with certain basic medications to ease most of the symptoms, especially things like body aches and pains, headache and fever.
There are also some good vitamins one can use to stay healthy,” he says.It’s also important to get enough rest and drink enough water or clear fluids to make sure that your urine stays a pale clear colour.
Most people with mild illness will start feeling better within a week of the first symptoms, but it’s important to monitor your symptoms carefully.
If you develop any emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing, chest pain or pressure in your chest that does not go away, coughing up blood, becoming confused, severe sleepi ness or blue lips or face you must call an ambulance or go to hospital immediately.For those who are not able to keep themselves away from others living in the home, government has setup free quarantine facilities around the country to keep you and your loved ones safe.The Western Cape Government recently published some comments from patients about its isolation facilities.Marie Jantjies from Witzenberg decided to follow healthcare workers’ advice and go to the isolation facility because her 97-year-old mother lives with her and her children and she wanted to protect them.
“I was treated very well.
The food was nice – even nicer than at home.
I realised I just had to stay positive.
I was anxious, but I prayed and tried to relax,” she said.“That place can save lives!
It really is the best,” said John Arnoldus, who recovered from COVID-19 at an isolation facility in Drakenstein.
“One of my friends was in quarantine at home and he struggled to recover on his own.
I told him to contact the people who cared for me – that is the way to get better.
The support of the medical staff and the manager there – that pulls you through,” he said.Arnoldus was initially hesitant to go to the isolation facility because of the wrong perception that if you go to a facility like this you will get sicker and die.
“I expected the worst, but I was received so well.
Hats off to the staff!
They explained to me that as I already have COVID-19, no one at the facility could make me sick,” he said.What can you expect from a quarantine facility?According to the Western Cape Government, all of your needs are taken of.
You will receive regular meals, health monitoring by a healthcare worker, laundry services, comfort and quiet while you recover and free transport to and from the facility.
“It’s also important to get enough rest and drink enough water or clear fluids to make sure that your urine stays a pale clear colour.”
Celebrating women through economic inclusion
vukuzenzele unnamed
In August South Africa celebrates Women’s Month.
This occasion marks the anniversary of the day in 1956 when 20,000 women marched to the Union Buildings – a great sea of womankind speaking many languages, from different places and of all races.
They were united in their demand for an end to the dreaded pass laws and for their right to live in freedom.
The status and position of women in South Africa today is vastly different to that faced by our mothers and grandmothers in 1956.
We have come a long way in realising a South Africa that is non-racial, non-sexist, dem-ocratic, prosperous and free.
There has been real pro-gress in improving the lives of South African women in the economy, in the political sphere and in public life.
At the same time, we know there is so much further we still have to go.
Women still face discrimination, harass-ment and violence, and bear the greatest brunt of poverty.
If we are to truly realise the promise of our Constitution we have to tackle the econom-ic and financial exclusion that makes women more vulnera-ble to abuse and violence.
We have joined a ground-breaking campaign that links us to global efforts to achieve gender equality by 2030.
Generation Equality is an ambitious and transform-ative agenda to end discrim-ination and violence against women and for their equal participation in political, social and economic life.As part of this campaign, we have joined two ‘Action Coalitions’, one for economic justice and rights and another against gender-based vio-lence.
Both of these themes are critical to our own nation-al agenda.
Eleven months since the Emergency Response Action Plan to combat gender-based violence and femicide was implemented we have made progress in expanding sup-port and care to survivors, and progress is being made in legal reforms to afford them greater protection.During the month of Au-gust, we begin the imple-mentation of the National Strategic Plan to combat gender-based violence and femicide.
A key aspect of the plan is on ensuring greater women’s financial inclusion.
This is because economic inequality and social inequal-ity are interconnected.
The economic status of women in South Africa makes them more vulnerable to abuse.
We must therefore scale up support for women to enable them to become financially independent.
We have made a number of commitments under Generation Equality that will be given effect to through the National Strate-gic Plan.Firstly, we are going to drive women’s economic inclusion through public procurement.
We have set the target of en-suring that at least 40 percent of goods and services pro-cured by public entities are sourced from women-owned businesses.
Secondly, we are going to scale up support for wom-en-owned SMMEs and for women who work in the informal sector or are un-employed.
This will include engagement with the finan-cial sector to make financial services accessible and af-fordable for women.
Thirdly, we want to ensure more women have access to productive assets such as land.
It is essential that women are beneficiaries of the accelerate land reform programme.
It is significant that of the R75 million in COVID-19 relief earmarked for farming input vouchers 53 percent of the beneficiaries will be rural women.
We must ensure that women subsist-ence and small-scale farmers continue to receive support beyond the pandemic.Fourthly, we want to ensure that women are protected from gender-based violence in the workplace.
In this re-gard, we will be working at a national and regional level towards the ratification of the ILO Convention on Violence and Harassment in the Work-place.
It is said that freedom is not given, but taken.
The emancipation of wom-en is only words on paper unless it is matched by com-mitment from all sectors of society.
As we prepare for the re-construction of our economy in the wake of the coronavi-rus pandemic, we have said that we cannot simply return to where we were before the outbreak of the virus.
We must build a fundamentally different economy which, among other things, substan-tially improves the material position of women.
This means that our invest-ment in infrastructure must support not only the devel-opment of local industry, but also women-owned business-es.
It must deliberately create employment opportunities for women in all stages of planning, financing, building and maintaining infrastruc-ture.
By the same measures, as we scale up our public employment programmes, we must ensure that young women in particular are identified as participants.
In addition to an income, these programmes will provide them with an opportunity to acquire some of the skills and experience necessary to enter the mainstream economy.As much as it is govern-ment’s responsibility to provide economic opportu-nities for women and create an enabling framework for advancing gender equality, everyone in society needs to play their part.Businesses must support women-owned enterprises in the procurement of goods and services.
They should employ more women and appoint more women to management positions.
This is all the more im-portant considering that the private sector’s record on gender-representation at management level lags be-hind that of the public sector.
This is an issue that is repeat-edly raised in engagements I have had with a number of women’s business organ-isations.
By equal measure, we must eliminate gender disparities in pay for men and women, and give effect to the principle of equal pay for equal work contained in the Employment Equity Act.Women must also be pro-tected from harassment and discrimination in the work-place.
It is up to transport operators, university admin-istrators, school governing bodies and religious organ-isations to create conditions for women and girls to travel, study and worship in safety.We must forge ahead with our efforts to eradicate chauvinism, sexism and pa-triarchy.
It is these attitudes that enable the oppression of women.
It is up to us – both men and women – to affirm that a woman’s value, position and opinions are no less than that of a man.
It is up to us as parents and grandparents to treat and raise our sons and our daughters the same.
It is up to us as men to reject and speak out against gender-based violence wher-ever we see it, even if it is against our friends, fathers or brothers.
Let us be the generation that ends the oppression of women in all its forms, in our lifetime.
The brave generation of 1956 marched for us all.
We owe it to them, to ourselves and to future generations to not betray this noble legacy.
Back to work after Covid-19 a full guide
Allison Cooper
When can you return to work if you have tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19)?
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases has the answers you need.
When I test positive for COVID-19, how long do I have to stay in isolation?People who test positive for COVID-19, but don’t have any symptoms, must remain in isolation at home or in a government isolation facili-ty for 10 days, from the day they receive their positive test result.Those who have mild symp-toms must remain in isolation at home or in a government isolation facility for 10 days, from the day their symptoms start.Those who have severe disease, who have to go to hospital, must remain in iso-lation for 10 days, from when they are stable and don’t need oxygen anymore.How can a COVID-19 positive people transfer the disease to others?According to Health Min-ister Zweli Mkhize, most people who have a mild infection can spread the virus for between seven to 12 days.
However, people who become very sick could be infectious and be able to transmit the virus to others for a longer period of time.Do I have to have anoth-er COVID-19 test, proving that I am negative, before I return to work?No.
Re-testing people who have experienced mild illness and have recovered is not recommended.
A person is considered safe to return to work and come out of isolation if they are no longer infectious.
This means they developed their first symptoms more than 10 days ago and have not had any symptoms for at least three days.In most cases, employees can return to work without testing again if:
• They have completed 10 days of mandatory quarantine or self-isolation.• Those who had moderate or severe symptoms undergo a medical evaluation.• They continue to practice personal hygiene and social distancing.• The employer monitors the worker to ensure they do not regress.• They wear a mask, from the date of diagnosis for at least 21 days.
I have tested negative but I still have symptoms.
What now?It is possible to get a false negative test result.
This means that your first test could be negative, but you could test positive at a later stage.
If you continue to have COVID-19 symptoms contact your healthcare professional.What if I am still show-ing symptoms after 10 days?It is common for patients to continue to have symptoms for longer than 10 days.
Full recovery may take several weeks.
If you still have symp-toms, seek advice from your healthcare professional.For more information about COVID-19, visit the National Institute for Communicable Diseases’ website at www.nicd.ac.za, the COVID-19 free website at coronavirus.datafree.co, call the COVID-19 Hotline Number at 0800 029 999 or send a WhatsApp to 0600 12 3456.
Building a society free of State capture
vukuzenzele unnamed
The scheduled hearings of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector, including Organs of State, recently ended, more than 1 000 days after the first witness testimony was heard.
While the commission’s chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has said it may be necessary for a few more witnesses to testify, the work of the commission is now one step closer to completion.This is a significant milestone that brings us ever closer to a reckoning with one of the most ruinous episodes in the history of our democracy.Even before Judge Zondo submits his findings and recommendations to the President, we can all agree that the commission’s work has been invaluable.
Over the course of three years, we have heard testimony detailing alleged acts of corruption on a massive scale.
We have heard about actions that resulted in the theft of billions of rands of public money.
We have heard how many public institutions and state-owned companies were deliberately weakened.This exposure of the nature, extent and depth of state capture did not take place behind closed doors, but was broadcast to the entire country.
By allowing all South Africans to follow the commission’s proceedings, it has helped to instil public confidence in our democracy in the way it promotes openness and transparency.The country owes a debt of gratitude to all who were involved in the work of the commission; from those who investigated, researched and compiled a huge amount of information; to the many witnesses who testified and provided evidence; to the journalists who diligently reported on the proceedings; to the lawyers who helped present evidence.We also owe a debt of gratitude to the many individuals, some of whom remain unknown, whose actions led to the establishment of the commission in the first place.
These are the people who unearthed these alleged criminal acts, who resisted, who spoke out and who took up campaigns – both public and behind the scenes – to end state capture.
It is thanks to them that we now speak of state capture in the past tense.State capture did not end of its own accord.
It was brought to an end by the concerted actions of South Africans from all walks of life, working in various areas to restore the values of our constitutional democracy.
And it is up to all of us to ensure that these practices are never allowed to happen again.Over the past three years, we have taken several important steps to tackle corruption and state capture.
We have been painstakingly rebuilding bodies like the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), the South African Police Service, the South African Revenue Service and others.
We have set up new structures, like the Investigating Directorate in the NPA to prosecute high-level corruption and the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) Special Tribunal to recover stolen public funds.
We have improved our crime-fighting capacity through the establishment of the Fusion Centre, which brings together various law-enforcement agencies to share information and coordinate the investigation and prosecution of crime.We have changed the leadership at several strategic state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and begun the process of restoring them to financial and operational health.
We are working towards a new SOE model that promotes greater transparency, accountability and sustainability.Much of this work is ongoing.
There are areas where progress has been far slower than we would have hoped, and these are now receiving closer attention.The findings and recommendations of the commission will undoubtedly strengthen these efforts.
We expect that the commission will identify some of the systemic weaknesses that allowed state capture to take place.
This will empower us to take further corrective measures.While we can say that the era of state capture is over, we have not defeated corruption.
Fraud and corruption remain pervasive and deeply entrenched in both the public and private sectors.Although it may not be on the scale of state capture, such criminal activities cost our country greatly, weaken our institutions and deprive South Africans of many basic needs.Corruption is deeply immoral at the best of times, but takes on a greater depravity in the midst of a humanitarian crisis.
One speaks here of the despicable acts of corruption last year in the procurement of goods and services needed for our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.We acted swiftly to stop such corruption, to identify those responsible and to take action against them.
This is proof of our commitment to root out corruption.We tightened up Treasury regulations, established the fusion centre and gave the SIU a wide-ranging mandate to investigate all COVID-19-related corruption allegations.
In a first for the country, we also published online the details of all COVID-19 procurement contracts across all public entities.The damage done to our country by state capture is deep.
Its effects will be felt for many years to come.
But, working together, we have started to put things right.
We have started to rebuild and restore.We can expect that the outcomes of the Zondo Commission will immeasurably strengthen these efforts.
They will give us an opportunity to make a decisive and lasting break with the state capture era.Much work lies ahead, and many challenges must still be confronted.
But we are on our way to building a society that is free from the evils of state capture and corruption.
Help prevent suicide
Allison Cooper
More people die as a result of suicide than HIV, malaria, breast cancer, war and homicide.
This is according to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) latest statistics, which show that over 700 000 people die by suicide each year – that is one in every 100 deaths and approximately one person every 40 seconds.“We cannot – and must not – ignore suicide,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.“Each one is a tragedy.
Our attention to suicide prevention is even more important now, after many months of living with the Coronavirus Disease pandemic, with many of the risk factors for suicide – job loss, financial stress and social isolation – still very much present,” he adds.
World Suicide Prevention DayWorld Suicide Prevention Day was launched on 10 September 2003, by the International Association for Suicide Prevention.It aims to prevent suicide and suicidal beha viour, alleviate its effects and provides a forum for academics, mental health professionals, crisis workers, volunteers and suicide survivors.According to the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG), there are 23 suicides and 230 serious suicide attempts recorded in South Africa daily.“Suicide is still a very taboo topic in our society – no one wants to talk about it; no one knows how to talk about it and parents don’t want to talk to their children about it in case it ‘plants ideas’.
However, it is a very real issue, and can be seen by the increasing daily calls we receive,” says Cassey Chambers, SADAG’s Operations Director.“If more people are aware of suicide and know how to get someone help before it’s too late, we can help reduce the suicide rate,” she says.Possible suicide warning signs include:
• Talking about ending one's life, dying or suicide.• Strong wish to die or a pre-occupation with death and dying.• Giving away prized possessions.• Signs of depression, such as moodiness, hopelessness, withdrawal, difficul ty with appetite and sleep, and loss of interest in usual activities.• Increased alcohol or drug use.• Hinting about not being around in the future or saying goodbye.• Drastic behaviour changes.• Making arrangements to take care of unfinished business.

the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) and the South African Post Office (SAPO) are ready to pay social grants to beneficiaries from 1 April with out interruptions.
SASSA Acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Pearl Bhengu made the announce-ment when she briefed the media on the state of readiness for SAPO to take over from Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) on paying social grants to beneficiaries.
In the past, SASSA relied on CPS services to pay cash payments, direct deposits and electronic payments.
SASSA and SAPO signed a service agreement in Decem-ber last year as a partnership to ensure the smooth pay-ment of social grants.
The pilot projects have suc cessfully been implemented since January this year when beneficiaries who receive grants via commercial banks, including Postbank, had money paid directly into their accounts.
According to Bhengu, SASSA has made direct payments to more than 2.3 million beneficiaries for the month of March, and this number will be increased in April 2018.
She said a total of 5.7 million beneficiaries transacting through the SASSA Payment Card will be paid directly by SASSA without the assis-tance of CPS in April.
This means that approximately 7.7 million of the 10.7 million beneficiaries will be paid directly.
At the moment, approximately 2.8 million benefi-ciaries receive their money in cash at SASSA pay points.
SAPO CEO Mark Barnes said the post office will en-sure that payments of social grants are uninterrupted from 1 April.
“The testing of the bulk account opening process with a sample of 1 000 existing SASSA beneficiaries data was seamlessly concluded in February,” said Barnes.
According to Barnes, the special disbursement account has the following features:
■ No deductions
■ Three free cash withdraw-als
■ One free balance enquiry per month
■ One free mini-statement per month
■ Free full statement cover ing up to a maximum of three months on demand
■ Free first replacement cardOld SASSA cards valid until September
Bhengu said beneficiaries who are still using old SAS-SA cards may continue to do so until 30 September 2018.
“We will soon introduce the new SASSA cards via the Post Office and beneficiaries will be informed about the process to be followed,” Bhengu added.
She also called on beneficiaries of social grants to ignore agents who claim that the current SASSA card has expired and is being replaced by another card.
Bridge brings relief for KZN learners
Nomfundo Mcetywa
Facing crocodiles and possibly drowning while crossing UThukela Riv -er to get to school is no longer a reality for learn ers in KwaDukuza and KwaMaphumulo.
This after the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport built two bridges which cross the UThukela River.
The Nyakana UThukela River Bridge, which cost R89.5 million to build serves the Mankenganeni community which is locat-ed on the northern side of the river.
The bridge links the Umlalazi and KwaDukuza local municipalities
SA moves to Alert Level 3
vukuzenzele unnamed
President Cyril Rama phosa has announced that South Africa has moved to Level 3 with effect from 1 June with more sectors of the economy opening and the removal of a number of restrictions on the movement of people.
Addressing the nation re cently on the developments in South Africa’s risk-adjusted strategy to manage the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the President says the country will have a differentiated approach to deal with areas that have far higher levels of infection and transmission.
COVID-19 hotspotsThese areas have been de clared as Coronavirus disease hotspots.
They include the following metros: City of Tshwane City of Johannesburg Ekurhuleni eThekwini Nelson Mandela Bay Buffalo City Cape Town.Other areas that have been identified as hotspots are the West Coast, Overberg and Cape Winelands district municipalities in the Western Cape, Chris Hani district in the Eastern Cape and iLembe district in KwaZulu-Natal.A hotspot is defined as an area that has more than five infected people per every 100 000 people or where new infections are increasing at a fast pace.
To deal with the virus in these areas, government will implement intensive interventions aimed at decreasing the number of new infections.“We are putting in place enhanced measures of surveillance, infection control and management.
We will assign a full-time team of experienced personnel to each hotspot,” the President says.This team will include epidemiologists, family practition ers, nurses, community health workers, public health experts and emergency medical services, to be supported by Cuban experts.“We will link each hotspot to testing services, isolation facilities, quarantine facilities, treatment, hospital beds and contact tracing.“Should it be necessary, any part of the country could be returned to alert levels 4 or 5 if the spread of infection is not contained despite our interventions and there is a risk of our health facilities being overwhelmed,” he says.The list of hotspot areas will be reviewed every two weeks depending on the progression of the virus.
Opening the economyThe implementation of alert level 3 which started at the beginning of June, involved the return to operation of most sectors of the econo my, subject to observance of strict health protocols and social distancing rules.
More public servants have also returned to work in accordance with provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and as guided by the Department of Public Service and Administration, working together with all other departments in government.
Protocols and workplace plansAs more sectors of the econ omy open, government will rely on social compacts with all key role players to address the key risk factors at the workplace and in the interface between employees and the public.“We will therefore be finalising a number of sector protocols and will require every company to develop a workplace plan before they re-open,” he says.According to these plans, companies will need to put in place sanitary and social distancing measures and facilities; they will need to screen workers on arrival each day, quarantine those who may be infected and make arrangements for them to be tested.“They also need to assist with contact tracing if employees test positive.
Because of their vulnerability, all staff who are older than 60 years of age and those who suffer from underlying conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer should ideally stay at home,” the President says.Employees who can work from home should be allowed to do so.Subject to these measures, all manufacturing, mining, construction, financial services, professional and business services, information technology, com munications, government services and media services, reopened from 1 June.
The appropriate restart and phasing in arrangements will need to be put in place for every workplace.“Wholesale and retail trade will be fully opened, including stores, spaza shops and informal traders.
E-commerce will continue to remain open.
Other sectors that opened previous ly, such as agriculture and forestry, utilities, medical services, food production and manufacture of hygiene products, will remain fully opened,” he says.
High-risk economic activities prohibitedHigh-risk economic activi ties will remain prohibited.
These include:
• Restaurants, bars and taverns, except for delivery or collection of food.• Accommodation and domestic air travel, except for business travel, which will be phased in on dates to be announced.• Conferences, events, entertainment and sporting activities.• Personal care services, including hairdressing and beauty services.
Movement of people and sale of alcoholPeople will be able to exer cise at any time during the day, provided this is not done in groups.
The curfew on the movement of people will be lifted.“Alcohol may be sold for home consumption only under strict conditions, on specified days and for limited hours.
Announcements in this regard will be made once we have concluded discussions with the sector on the various conditions,” the President says.The sale of tobacco products will remain prohibited in alert level 3, due to the health risks associated with smoking.“All gatherings will remain prohibited, except for funerals with no more than 50 people or meetings in the workplace for work purposes,” he says.
Expect rise in infectionsPresident Ramaphosa says, in preparation for the expected increase in COVID-19 infections in the country, around 20 000 hospital beds have been, and are being, repurposed for COVID-19 cases, and 27 field hospitals are being built around the country.
“A number of these hospitals are ready to receive coronavirus patients.” The President says government appreciates the work that continues to be done by public servants, especially those in the front line in the fight against COVID-19.“The safety of all workers, including public servants, is a matter of concern to us.
We will continue to make all efforts for the adequate provision of personal protection equipment to ensure safety for everyone while at work.“Our priority is to reduce the opportunities for the transmission of the virus and create a safe environment for everyone,” he says.
Tips to follow to avoid being infected by the coronavirus disease.
»Stay at home as much as you can.
»Remember to social distance.
»Wear your face mask.
»Wash your hands with soap thoroughly.
Wash the back of your hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Always wash your hands with soap before you eat and after being out in public.
»Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when you cough and sneeze.
Avoid touching your face with dirty hands at all times.
»Seek medical help if you feel unwell.
Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include coughing, runny nose, fever and shortness of breath.
If you are ex-periencing any of these symptoms, seek medical attention promptly.

Let us protect and support our children
vukuzenzele unnamed
The International Day for Protection of Children, which is commemorated globally on 03 June, draws attention to children's rights around the world and welfare.
Fittingly, it is also the UN Global Day of Parents on the same day, honouring the commitment of parents and caregivers to the wellbeing of children.
I want to thank the millions of parents, grandparents and caregivers around South Africa who continue to play an important role in the formative years in the lives of our youngest citizens.
The encouragement, sup port and protection children receive from their parents and caregivers is essential for their future happiness and success.
On 01 June the country started a new phase in its fight against the coronavirus.
Many economic and social activities restarted, including a phased resumption of schooling.
We have said that we are taking a gradual approach, guided by the advice of our scientists and led by the realities on the ground and consultations with stakeholders.
In the last few weeks, as we have prepared to return to school, we have had extensive and detailed discussions with all role-players in the education sphere.
These have guided our approach to this complex and challenging task.
Several of these stakeholders – including teachers and parents – have expressed concern about the state of readiness in many schools.
We have heard them, we welcome their contributions and are taking steps to address their concerns as well as proposals.
It is understandable that many parents and caregivers have mixed emotions at this time about the reopening of schools.
There is relief that children will be able to resume their education after a prolonged absence from classrooms and lecture halls.
Young people are eager to be in school again and to see friends and teachers.
But there is also apprehension on the part of parents, edu cators and learners themselves.
Parents want reassurance that the necessary precautions should be in place to adequate-ly protect learners.
The safety of our youngest citizens from a health and physical perspective is not negotiable.
It is our foremost priority.
As we prepare for the gradual re-opening of our schools and places of higher learning, education authorities have been hard at work putting the necessary health and safety measures in place.
That documentation regarding standard operating procedures have been provided to all schools.
These standard operating procedures cover issues like train ing and orientation of screen ers, timetable realignment and configuring classrooms to meet social distancing requirements.
We are continuing with the process of delivering personal protective equipment and ensuring the availability of water and sanitation services.
Learning, once it commences, will take place under strict conditions with a correctly limited number of learners and students.
As parents, teachers, governing bodies and government, we are in agreement that no school should re-open until all the necessary precautions are in place.
There needs to be transparency about the level of preparedness of each of the schools.
Everyone who is a key role player, be they a parent, a school governing body member, a teacher or a government official should be able to have the correct information about the state of preparedness of each school.
It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the learning environment is safe.
I want to salute parents and caregivers, in particular, for the role they have played over the last two months.
With schools closed, they have had to take greater daily responsibility for the education and development of their children.
Many parents and caregivers have had to assist learners with their schoolwork at home, no doubt gaining a keen appreciation of the hard work being done by our teachers every day.
Once the lockdown is lifted and more learners return to school, we parents should continue to play a more active role in the education of our children, whether it is through joining school governing bod-ies, volunteering our services at schools or other forms of assistance.
Parents can join in volunteering to clean schools, establishing vegetable gardens or being part of neighbourhood school safety committees.
This can turn the schools into real, meaningful “community schools”.
Though we may feel anxious and fearful as our sons and daughters leave our care, we must draw courage from the fact that every effort is being made to protect them.
As parents, you have entrusted us with the welfare and safety of your children.
It is a responsibility we do not take lightly.
In the days and weeks to come, we will be closely monitoring the return to school.
If we follow the protocols and maintain all precautions – as parents, educators, communities and learners – we will effectively minimise the risk posed by the coronavirus.
Ultimately it is both our personal actions and our collective efforts that will keep our children safe.
Whatever we do next, we need to do together.
Parenting a child with epilepsy
Allison Cooper
While it may be a shock for a family to learn that a child has epilepsy, you can build an understanding, loving and accepting environment in which your child can grow and believe in their ability to succeed.
According to Epilepsy South Africa, parents could be concerned about their child’s future and find epilep-sy difficult to accept or talk about.
You may feel angry, depressed, inadequate and guilty, but you can overcome these feelings and your anx-iety by educating yourself about the condition.Epilepsy is the tendency to have recurrent seizures, which occur when there is an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain.
Why my child?Understanding epilepsy and why seizures occur doesn’t explain why this happened to your child.In approximately 66% of cases, the underlying cause of epilepsy is unknown.
This is referred to as idiopathic ep-ilepsy.
In the remaining cases the underlying causes can be identified, which is known as symptomatic epilepsy.
There can be a variety of underlying causes such as a head injury, that can occur at any age; a birth injury, such as a lack of oxygen during birth; fever convulsions, encephali-tis, meningitis or childhood measles; and metabolic or biochemical disturbances or imbalances.A doctor will prescribe medication based on the age, physical condition and type of seizures your child has.
Remember, anti-convulsant medication does not cure epilepsy but, in most cases, will reduce the frequency and severity of seizures.Some tips on parenting a child with epilepsy:
• Make your child aware of the condition.
Children as young as three can understand that the brain controls the body.
Older children should be given a more comprehensive explanation.• Inform close relatives and your child’s friends, teachers and other responsible school officials.
• Ensure your child receives a comprehensive medical assessment by a qualified professional, ideally a neurologist.• Emphasise your child’s abilities and any activity that will improve their self-acceptance, self-worth and self-confidence.
• Ensure adult supervision for some activities, such as swimming.• Ensure medication is administered and taken reg ularly as prescribed.• Provide a set routine with plenty of rest, three balanced meals per day and regular exercise.• When explaining seizures use words that your child will understand.• Never allow your child to use seizures as an excuse for getting out of chores or accepting responsibility.
A better 2021 for all South Africans The first weeks of the year have been difficult for all South Africans.
Vukuzenzele Unnamed
The coronavirus pandemic has gotten worse, with new infections increasing far faster and far higher than before.
Hospitals have been under great strain as more people have needed medical attention.
While most economic sec-tors have been able to operate again for several months, it will take some time for the economy to recover and for lost jobs to be restored.
As the new year starts, many fami-lies are still feeling the effects of the pandemic on their lives and livelihoods.
The world is now entering the second year of the coro-navirus pandemic.
For South Africa, as for most countries around the world, the year 2021 will be extremely chal-lenging.
The second wave of COVID-19 infections may well be followed by further waves, which will threaten both the health of our peo-ple and the recovery of our economy.Difficult as this year will be, I am certain that we will overcome the pandemic and set our country firmly on the path to recovery.
My confidence comes from the South African people.
If I look at how South Africans responded to this crisis from the moment the virus arrived on our shores, I have no doubt that we have the resil-ience, discipline and ability to defeat this disease.
Certainly there were excep-tions, but the vast majority of South Africans understood the need for restrictions on their movement and activ-ities, and complied with the regulations that we had to put in place.
Even more important than compliance, most South Africans took responsibility for themselves and for others, following advice on issues like social distancing, wearing a mask and hand washing.And where we fell short, we have, sadly, seen the conse-quences.
We now know about the risks of closed spaces and crowded gatherings, of not wearing masks and not keeping our distance from others.
This bodes well for the year ahead.
We now know much more about the disease and how to prevent its spread.
And despite what one could call ‘pandemic fatigue’, we are no less determined as South Africans to do what needs to be done.
As we adhere even more rigorously to the basic pre-vention measures, we will also be rolling out a mass vaccination campaign.
As more and more people are vaccinated, we will both save lives and progressively reduce the risk of infection across the population.
Getting enough vaccines as quickly as possible – and making sure that they reach the people who need them – will be one of the biggest tasks of the year.
This will be particularly challenging as every country in the world is clamouring to secure a limited supply of vaccines.
But we are hard at work with partners in business, labour and civil society to make this happen.
We are working on several fronts to get vaccines, including through the global COVAX facility, the African Union initiative and through our own engagements with vaccine manufacturers.
As we act together to overcome the pandemic, we will need to work together to rebuild and transform our economy.
We have both the ability and the will to stimulate economic activity, grow our economy and create jobs.
And to do so in the midst of a pandemic.Public finances are under extreme strain, now even more so because of the cost of our health response to COVID-19 and the social and economic relief measures we put in place to assist businesses and poor households.
The contraction of the economy also meant that tax revenue has declined significantly.
There are some parts of the economy that will take longer to recover due to lower global demand generally and restrictions on international travel.That is why we need to be innovative and focused in our plans to rebuild the economy.
Significantly, the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan that we announced in October last year is based on broad consensus among all social part ners on the actions needed to rebuild the economy.
This lays a firm basis for effective cooperation that draws on the resources, capabilities and energies of all sections of society.We are seeing this in various practical ways.
For example, we have been working closely with private funders and multilateral development institutions to prepare infrastructure projects in areas like transport, human settlements, water and telecommunications.
Using the Infrastructure Fund as one of the vehicles, we are developing funding models for these projects that draw on several sources in both the public and private sectors.
This is particularly important at a time when public finances are limited.The Presidential Employment Stimulus is another example of partnership in action.
Understanding that it will take time for economic growth to translate into private sector employment, we have launched the employment stimulus to start creat ing work opportunities now.
This programme is being coordinated from the Presiden cy, but is being implemented by a range of government departments and different spheres.
Through this programme, tens of thousands of unemployed people are able to both earn and learn as they provide valuable social services.In time, this programme will include a ‘social employment’ part, where we will partner with other social actors to employ people in a variety of activities – from improving food security, to tackling gender-based violence to upgrading informal settlements – that all contribute to the common good.
All this work is being reinforced by an aggressive focus on those economic reforms that will have the greatest focus on growth.
These include the expansion of electricity generation capacity, making our ports more efficient and competitive, improving access to affordable broadband, and improving turnaround times for water, mining and other licenses.
These efforts are being coordinated and monitored jointly by my office and National Treasury.
There is much to be done in the year ahead.
And we should be in no doubt that we will have to confront many daunting challenges.
But we have shown that, as a nation, we are able to suc-ceed when we work together in pursuit of a common pur-pose.
If we remember that, and if we put our unity into action, we will ensure that 2021 brings better health and better lives to all our people.
I wish you all the best for the new year.
Plans to drastically change TB treatment
vukuzenzele unnamed
Patients with Multidrug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) will now be able to receive life changing treatment as the Department of Health begins its roll-out of Bedaquiline.
According to the department’s drug resistant TB director, Norbert Ndjeka Bedaquiline will replace the old regimen, which makes use of injections to administer MDR-TB treatment.
“This means that for the first time, an injection-free regimen will be recommended for all patients with Rifampicin Resistant Tuberculosis in South Africa.
Additionally, patients with MDR-TB will now also receive Bedaquiline as part of a more patient friendly short regimen, which is expected to improve adherence and ensure success,” he said.
The introduction of Bedaquiline has earned South Africa the top spot as the first country in the world to dispense this type of treatment.
The department says Bedaquilline has been hailed for its effective treatment and short turnaround time.
“Treating patients with drug resistant TB was difficult with old medicines, which had many negative side effects and over long periods often up to 24 months.” In addition, the treatment is revered for reducing the number of deaths and having fewer side effects in comparison to its injectable counterpart, which resulted in hearing loss for many MDR-TB patients.
The department began the roll-out of Bedaquiline across the country in July.
“We started the roll-out with facilities that are ready to implement.
This will be done in a phase by phase approach.
We will then assist and capacitate those provinces that need assistance,” said Ndjeka.
It is anticipated that rollout across the country will be concluded between the next three to six months.
Young female farmer leads in YAFF awards
Keamogetse Kgomanyane
Being born with a disability did not stop Landiswa Diniso from achieving her dream of being a farmer.
In fact, it encouraged her to work harder.
The 28-year-old is the owner of Landiswa Diniso Livestock Enterprise in Burgersdorp in the northern part of the Eastern Cape.
She walked away with the Special Ministerial Award for a young entrepreneur living with a disability at the recently held 2018 Youth in Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (YAFF) awards.
Diniso was born with a disability in her left leg and has to wear a brace for support.
However, she has not allowed her disability to limit her.
As a young woman who grew up on a farm and later moved to a township in the Eastern Cape, Diniso said her journey into farming started over three years ago when her uncle gave her a calf.
She kept her calf in a grazing area and in 2015 the same animal which was now a cow had a calf.
This inspired the farmer to continue in the farming business and she approached the Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform for support.
She received animal feed and goats to start her business.
Today, the enterprise has grown to include a herd of 10 cattle, seven goats, eight pigs and a small patch where Diniso plants vegetables for the household and sells the surplus to the local community.
This has become a means of livelihood for Diniso and her family.
She wishes to become a successful livestock farmer in the future and become an inspiration to the younger generation.
With the prize money of R50 000 she said it would help her start her goals.
“The prize money will really assist my business.
I believe farming is important because it creates job opportunities for unemployed youth,” said Diniso.
Speaking at the awards ceremony, the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Senzeni Zokwana, said the nominees and recipients of the YAFF awards were proof that the youth is interested in the agriculture sector.
Monkeypox in South Africa
Vukuzenzele Unnamed
HEALTH Health Minister Dr Joe Phaahla has confirmed that Monkeypox has been detected in South Africa during a recent media briefing in Pretoria, Gauteng.
He said he received a report from the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) that they have confirmed Monkeypox in South Africa through laboratory tests.
The virus has been detected in Gauteng and the Western Cape.
Monkeypox is usually a mild disease manifesting as blisters or sores on the skin.
It is usually mild and with a fatality rate of 1 percent.
The disease has previously been reported in African countries such as Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Ghana in the early 2000s.
The current outbreak is dominated by high numbers in Europe with the UK leading with over 700 cases, Spain with just over 500, followed by Germany, Portugal and France.
The Minister said the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) is conducting online in-service training for health workers to be able to detect the disease so that necessary laboratory tests can be done.“The disease only spreads through close contact, so you cannot get it by being in the same room with an infected person,” the Minister said.
Minister Phaahla assu red South Africans that Monkeypox is not a virus which has never been seen before and scientists have information about it.
Chairperson of the Minis -terial Advisory Committee (MAC) on COVID-19 and Executive member of NHLS, Professor Koleka Mlisana, said Monkeypox is a disease that is endemic in Central and Northern Africa which has been known to be mild.
An endemic disease is a condition regularly found among particular people or in a certain area.She said there are simila rities between Monkeypox and Smallpox.
“There are vaccines and treatment available for Monkeypox.
The disease presents itself with flu like symptoms and Legionnaires.
The important thing is that somebody who comes up with a clinical picture is easy to diagnose and most importantly it is difficult to transmit, unlike a respiratory virus, because it is by contact.
You would only get it when you have come in direct contact with somebody who is infected,” she said.
Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia.
Professor Mlisana said contact tracing is important in this case and the Health Department will continue to do that.
She assured South Africans that the Laboratory infrastructure has all the adequate resources to be able monitor any new infections that may arise.

Our nation mourns the young lives lost in Enyobeni tavern tragedy
Vukuzenzele Unnamed
A few weeks ago the families of a township in Scenery Park outside East London, received news that every parent prays they never get to hear.
They were told that 21 of their children had been found dead, in a tavern.
The youngest child was only 13 years old.
The police investigation into the tragedy is proceeding apace.
Flowing from the investigations, the Buffalo City Metro is looking into whether the tavern violated any municipal regulations.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who are struggling to come to terms with this unspeakable horror.
We commend the Eastern Cape provincial government for assisting the affected families, as well as AVBOB that has pledged to assist the families with the burials.
Even as the relevant authorities deconstruct what happened to ensure there is justice for the victims, there is a conversation we do need to have as a country.
It is the problem of under-age drinking.
The footage and images posted online of the socalled ‘pens down’ party at the venue that night show revelling youngsters clutching bottles of alcohol.
Many of those in the images look barely out of their teens.
A number of young people from Scenery Park have told the media of having seen a post circulated on social media, offering free rounds of alcohol to all who attended the event that night.
The increased social acceptability of young people drinking alcohol has become a serious problem in a country where the majority of the drinking population are already classified by the World Health Organization as binge drinkers.
Alcohol use amongst adolescents is associated with impaired function, absenteeism from learning, alcohol-related injuries, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and risky behaviour.
We must come together to combat this vice that is robbing our young people of the best years of their lives, and making them susceptible to alcohol addiction.
As families it means having open and frank conversations about alcohol and setting boundaries.
Children under the age of 18 consuming alcohol is against the law.
As adults we should refrain from practices such as sending minors to buy alcohol for us or capitulating to requests to buy these young people alcohol.
It is not the first time we have been confronted with tragic events such as what happened in Scenery Park last week.
A common denominator between Enyobeni tavern, the Throb nightclub disaster in Durban in 2000, and the Osi’s tavern tragedy in Khayelitsha in 2015, is that these establishments were selling liquor to minors.
The proliferation of establishments openly flouting the law points to failings on the part of authorities to enforce regulations.
Under the National Liquor Act, owners of establishments with liquor licenses may not sell alcohol to anyone under the age of 18.
They must also take reasonable steps to ensure anyone they are selling alcohol to is of age.
We call on communities to work with authorities to ensure that taverns, shebeens, entertainment venues and outlets breaking the law face the consequences.
We call upon our police to step up the enforcement of laws that prohibit the sale of alcohol close to schools and enhance monitoring of outlets to ensure alcohol is not being sold to minors.
Another reality is that alcohol is a form of escapism for young people in communities were opportunities for safe and age-appropriate recreation are few.
The Scenery Park community has pointed to the lack of sports, learning and other developmental facilities for young people, leading them to resort to ‘tavern hopping’.
In the wake of the tragedy, the community has pointed out that there are no viable sports grounds, community libraries or youth centres in Scenery Park.
As government at national, provincial and local level we need to respond to the pleas of this community and those of other communities by developing more recreational spaces, facilities, programmes, and projects for our young people in disadvantaged areas in the province.
Other social partners such as the business community should also assist with sponsorship.
As communities we must work with our Community Policing Forums, with our civics organisations and with our school governing bodies and play a more active role in the lives of our children and in ensuring their safety and well-being.
As they say in our African indigenous classics “it takes a community to raise a child”.
Let us work together to protect our precious future generation from the ravages of alcohol and drug abuse and their effects.
Let us work together to ensure that those who put profit before the lives of our children are not allowed to operate.
Let us also set a positive example in our own relationship with alcohol.
Let us be keepers of not just our own children, but our neighbours’ children as well.
Mahlangu showcases Ndebele heritage to the world

Dr Esther Mahlangu (82) is the perfect embodi ment of what can be achieved by embracing your heritage.
Mahlangu is known all over the world as the South African artist from the Ndebele nation who uses her contemporary painting style to represent amaNdebele.
Her work has been featured by various local and international brands such as BMW, Honda, British Airways, Albany and Tastic rice, to mention a few.
It has also been showcased in many art exhibitions across the globe.
Vuk’uzenzele visited her home near Mthambothini in Mpumalanga to speak to her about the importance of embracing heritage and culture.
“My heritage is part of who I am.
It is important for everyone to love who they are and respect their culture.
Respecting your culture can take you places and also put food on your table,” she said.

Drawing roads in the sky
More Matshediso
Pilots do not just fly aeroplanes all over the sky; they have to use certain routes and follow procedures to ensure that they take-off and land safely.
The only way for pilots to know which route to follow from one airport to another is through services of a Flight Procedure Design Specialist.
This Transport month, Vuk’uzenzele spoke to Mpho Chepape (29) who is one of the four Flight Procedure Design Specialists at the Air Traffic Navigation Services (ATNS).
ATNS is a company that renders air traffic control and management solutions for South Africa, as well as 10 percent of the world’s airspace.
Chepape’s job is to design routes for use by air traffic controllers and pilots.
He said a key priority in his field of work is safety.
“We design route procedures both locally and internationally to protect flights from crashing into obstacles such as buildings and other structures.
What I normally tell people when they ask me about my job is that I draw roads in the sky,” he said.
Chepape said safety is number one priority in aviation, so he constantly has to analyse the environment where flights will be taking off and where they will be landing in order to avoid unfortunate incidents.
Part of his job is to liaise with stakeholders including pilots, airports management, air traffic controllers and the South African Weather Services in order for him to design efficient flight procedures.
He said his job is exciting yet complex because the environment is not always the same.
“Every day is different, so there is no routine in designing the routes for flights,” he said.
He joined the company in 2011 as an air traffic service officer.
“I had no idea that there are Flight Procedure Design Specialists.
I only learned about this when I was an Air Traffic Service Officer and then I applied to get the job,” he said.
Chepape has undergone an extensive flight procedure design course at the Air Navigation Institute in Switzerland and then received 12 to 18 months on-the-job training.
Chepape adds that high school scholars interested in pursuing a career in flight procedure design should ensure that they do well in in Mathematics and Science.
Tyre factory creates jobs in KZN
vukuzenzele unnamed
About 600 jobs have been created in La dysmith KwaZu lu-Natal thanks to a R970 million direct investment by Japanese tyre manufac turing company Sumito mo Rubber South Africa (SRSA).
Sumitomo manufactures the popular Dunlop, Sumitomo and Falken tyre brands.
It has taken a step further by recently launching its new, state-of-the-art Truck and Bus Radial (TBR) factory.Ladysmith mayor Vincent Mayiboyi Madlala said the investment from the Asian company was not just about the people of Ladysmith but will also benefit the province through job creation and growing the economy.
“The factory has created about 600 job opportunities in the municipality of Ladysmith since the inception of the com pany in our city.
With the new expansion it is expected to create a further 400 permanent jobs,” said Madlala.He added that with skills shortage being a challenge in Ladysmith, Sumitomo also took to other areas in the province such as Richards Bay and Escourt providing decent jobs for people in those areas.
“In some cases the compa ny has taken people from our province for training in other countries in our continent where they have a footprint.
To us this is boosting skills development for people in our city and province,” Mayor Madlala added.
Production Trainee Special ist at the SRSA factory, Sifiso Vilakazi is one of the people who has been equipped with skills.
‘TBR has changed my life by providing me with skills, knowledge and training in different processes of tyre technology.
It has improved my financial position and enabled me to think bigger about my future.”
Free training and services for businesses
Vukuzenzele Unnamed
Three government entities are firmly focused on enabling the ease of doing business in South Africa to grow the economy.
A recent VukTalks webinar, hosted by Govern ment Communication and Information System, was held to raise awareness of the mandate, policies and services provided by the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC), Companies Tribunal (CT) and the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) Commission.
These are all entities of the Department of Trade, Indus try and Competition.
According to Ofentse Shakung, the CIPC’s Manager of Innovation and Collaboration and Director of E-learning, the CIPC has various functions, including the registration of companies, cooperatives and intellectual property rights (trademarks, patents, designs and copyright).
The CIPC developed its BizPortal platform to offer online company registration and related services to simplify the process of register ing a business and adhering to requirements.
BizPortal offers those wanting to start a business a one-stop platform to register a company, register for tax, register a domain name, apply for a B-BBEE certificate, register for the Compensation Fund and Unemployment Insurance Fund, and open a business bank account.
“It’s a paperless process and the company will be registered within 24 hours of submission.
We have also added Google business services, which enables companies to host a business profile and static company website on Google for free,” said Shakung.
To make use of these services, visit www.bizportal.
gov.za and click on ‘register’ at the top of the page.
The portal is easy to navigate and offers step-by-step information on how to register a business.
Free training
The CIPC also recently launched free online training platform Learn-i-Biz to help small, medium and micro enterprise directors and entrepreneurs build their capacity to run successful businesses, while ensuring they comply with the legal requirements.
“The platform is a digital study guide and includes video tutorials and a self-examination for each of the seven modules,” said Shakung.
The modules include training on what a company and a director is, key persons in a company, responsibilities of a director, personal financial interests and conflict of interest, re muneration of directors and distributions and the board of directors.
To register for the training, visit www.elearning@cipc.co.za.
Companies Tribunal
Dr Mohammed Chicktay, the Chairperson of the CT, explained that the entity helps provide a speedy resolution in company disputes, relating to applications and complaints made in terms of the Companies Act No.
71 of 2008.
These include disputes relating to company names, directorship and exemption from establishing social and ethics committees.
It also reviews compliance notices issued by the CIPC, relating to time extensions to prepare annual financial statements and convene annual general meetings.
“The CT deals with various applications.
During COVID-19, for example, we received many applications for an extension of the date to convene an annual general meeting,” said Chicktay.
Another free service offered by the CT is dispute resolution.
A person may refer a matter for resolution by mediation, conciliation or arbitration, as an alternative to going to court.
The CT serves as a facilitator between the parties.
“The CT encourages mediation to save jobs, especially during COVID-19, and people should start using it more,” said Chicktay.
B-BBEE Commission
According to Lindiwe Madonsela, the B-BBEE Commission’s Senior Manager Compliance, the entity’s mandate is to oversee, supervise and promote adherence to the B-BBEE Act 46 of 2013.
It also investigates fronting practices; aims to increase knowledge and promote public awareness around B-BBEE, by implementing education and awareness measures; and provides guidance to the public.
Any person who suspects or is aware of a violation of the Act, such as where black people are used as fronts to achieve B-BBEE points, may lodge a complaint with the commission.
For an example, employees in an entity may be aware that the entity is prac ticing fronting by presenting black people as shareholders or executives, when they are not, Madonsela said.
Work together to strengthen democracy
Vukuzenzele Unnamed
As South Africa entered the new year, we were confronted by two pro found events that remind ed us, in different ways, of what brings us together as a people.
On the first day of 2022, the nation gathered in spirit to bid farewell to Arch bishop Desmond Tutu at St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town.
It was a moment of great sadness as we recalled the life and contribution of a beloved compatriot who was, in many ways, the moral conscience of our nation.
At the same time, his funeral was a celebration of the values he stood for.
It was a celebration of the great unity and diversity of our people, and a reminder of the sacrifices made by so many to achieve our democracy.
On the second day of 2022, the country watched on in horror as a huge fire engulfed our Parliament, just a hundred metres from where we had gathered the day before to pay our last respects to Archbishop Tutu.
We are relieved that there was no loss of life and that no-one was injured in the fire.
We are extremely gra teful to the firefighters who battled the blaze and finally extinguished it.
The investigations into the cause of the fire are now underway.
We need to ensure that these investigations are thorough and concluded without delay.
The country needs to know what happened.
Arrangements are being made to ensure that the work of Parliament can continue even if the buildings cannot be used.
It is vital that Parliament continues to consider and pass laws that will transform society and continues to provide oversight and ensure accountability as government works to implement the mandate it received from the people.
Apart from the close proximity of St George’s Cathedral and Parliament, what connects these two events is that each reminds us of what brings us together as South Africans: our democracy.
We mourn Desmond Tutu because he was the spiritual father of our democracy.
We despair at the devas tation of our Parliamentary buildings because they are the seat of our democracy.
They are the place where our new democratic Constitution was adopted just over 25 years ago, and where hundreds of trans formative laws have been passed.
We may not always recognise it, but the fire at Parliament demonstrated how strongly South Africans feel about their democracy.
It is a reminder also of how important it is that we work to strengthen and defend that democracy.
While the Parliamentary buildings have been damaged beyond use, the institution of Parliament continues its work in the service of the people.
This is an important reminder that our democratic institutions are not defined by the buildings that house them, but by the work they do and by the confidence that the people have in them.
This is true of all the institutions of our democracy.
Just as the fire in Parliament was finally being extinguished, Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo submitted the first part of the report of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.
This part of the report details how several public institutions were infiltrated, looted and severely damaged.
These include state-owned enterprises like South African Airways, the Government Communication and Information System and the South African Revenue Service.
This part of the report paints a deeply disturbing picture of how key instituti ons of our democracy were compromised and undermined with criminal intent.
Not only were significant amounts of money stolen, but these institutions were not able to properly fulfil the functions for which they were established.
The findings and recommendations of the Zondo Commission will help the country to rebuild these institutions and to hold those responsible to account.
We must ensure that we use them to safeguard these institutions into the future so that they may never be captured again.
We must safeguard against any and all efforts to diminish our hard-won democracy – whether these efforts take the form of corruption in state-owned enterprises, the subversion of our law enforcement agencies, the sabotage of our economic infrastructure, or attacks on the independence and integrity of our judiciary.
We need to protect our Constitution, our democratic state and the electoral process from anyone who wants to weaken our democracy and deny the South African people of their hard-won freedom.
There are many challenges that we must confront as we work to rebuild and recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As we do so, let us draw strength and encouragement from our deep dedication to our democracy and our common desire to build a nation that is united, free and equal.
I wish you all the best for the year ahead.

Our country has moved to alert level 2 in our response to the coronavirus pandemic.
This has come as a relief to all South Africans who have had to live under stringent restrictions for the last five months.
It is a sign of the progress we are making in reducing new infections and demand on our health facilities.
It is also a very important development as we strive to restart our economy.
But it is too soon to celebrate.
We are still very much in the middle of a deadly pandemic that has taken over 11,000 lives in South Africa alone.
At more than half a million confirmed cases, we still have the fifth highest number of infections in the world.
And there is always a chance of a resurgence of the disease.
If we ever need a stark reminder of the need for vigilance, we should look to recent events thousands of kilometres away in New Zealand.
Three months since the country was declared coronavirus-free, New Zealand is once again under lockdown.
Although the latest outbreak was of relatively few cases, the government swiftly re-imposed lockdown restrictions.
Similar restrictions have had to be reimposed in several parts of Europe as they experience a ‘second wave’ of infections.
These experiences show just how swiftly things can change when it comes to COVID-19.
It is a wake-up call to any among us who may harbour illusions that we are even close to seeing the end of this grave public health emergency.
Certainly, there are signs of hope.
The number of new confirmed cases in South Africa continues to decline.
At the peak of the disease just one month ago, we were recording around 12,000 new cases a day.
This has dropped to an average of around 5,000 a day over the past week.
Our recovery rate stands at 80 percent.
As the country moves to alert level 2, many restrictions on social and economic activity have been lifted.
With this comes increased risk of transmission.
We now need to manage this risk and ensure the gains we have made thus far in containing the pandemic’s spread are not reversed.
The greatest threat to the health of nation right now is complacency.
It may be that we are now permitted to meet friends and family, to visit entertainment venues, to travel for leisure and to consume alcohol in restaurants, bars and taverns.
But as the old adage goes, just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.
Many people who have the coronavirus do not have symptoms and may not even know they are infected.
This is a sobering reality because it means that any of us could be infected right now and could unwittingly infect others.
This is particular the case when visiting relatives, especially the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions that render them vulnerable to infection.
It is also true for attending religious services or cultural activities.
The ‘second wave’ of infections that several other countries have experienced is an ever-present possibility for us too.
Although many restrictions have been lifted, it does not mean they will not return should we experience a significant rise in infections.
This pandemic is a matter of life and death.
We need to adapt and we need to be vigilant.
In the days, weeks and months that lie ahead, we must urgently focus our efforts on recovery.
Our economy and our society has suffered a great deal.
As we return to economic activity across almost all industries – and work to repair the damage done – we have a responsibility to not let our guard down as individuals, employers, communities, families, professionals, workers and citizens.
None of us wants a return to the early days of extreme lockdown restrictions.
We want to move on with our lives.
We want our friends and loved ones to remain healthy and safe.
As a nation, let us continue to work together to ensure that we progress.
The move to alert level 2 of the lockdown is not a ‘free for all.’ The rules on social distancing, mask wearing, social gatherings and international travel remain.
Our success rests on our ability to abide by these regulations and to ensure that we each behave carefully and responsibly.Every time we are considering any form of non-essen tial activity, we should ask: what is the risk of infection to ourselves and to others?
Where there is a risk, even a slight one, it is better not to do it.
Let us proceed, as ever, with caution.
Let us keep each other safe.
NSFAS powered my dreams
More Matshediso
The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has bridged the financial gap between Karabo Mashego (21) and his plan to further his studies.
Mashego of Sebokeng in Gauteng’s Vaal area says he would not have managed to afford tuition fees and the other expenses that come with post-matric education had he not received a bursary from NSFAS.
“In addition, the monthly allowance I receive from NSFAS enables me to sleep and study on a full stomach,” he says.
Mashego is a third-year student studying towards a degree in civil engineering at the University of Pretoria.“Tuition fees are very expensive.
For the course that I have chosen, I really could not afford to pay for a semester, never mind a single academic year,” he explains.
Mashego matriculated in 2016 and was a top learner in his class, but had no means to pay for his studies.
He successfully applied for funding from NSFAS for the 2018 academic year.
“This gave me the opportunity to make my dream of studying engineering come true.
Education plays a huge role in my personal development and it helps me to progress in all that I intend to achieve.
Moreover, it empowers me to empower other people in my community and thus contribute to the economy of our country,” Mashego explains.
“I urge young people to apply for NSFAS funding because following your dream is not a free exercise, it needs funding, and NSFAS will bridge that gap for you,” he says.
The Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Dr Blade Nzimande, has opened the NSFAS 2021 application cycle for a period of four months, from 3 August to 30 November 2020.
Students from disadvan -taged and working-class backgrounds who wish to further their studies at any public technical and vocational education and training (TVET) college or university may apply.To be eligible for NSFAS funding, an applicant must be a South African citizen and come from a family with a combined annual household income of not more than R350 000.
The household annual income for students with a disability should not be more than R600 000.
“In the current academic year, NSFAS has funded over 700 000 students, 248 242 at TVET colleges and 481 339 at universities (students with registrations data).
This is a 20 percent increase from the previous year when we compared registration data received in the same period of 2019 versus 2020,” says Minister Nzimande.
NSFAS accounts for 40 percent of the undergraduate population at universi ties and 70 percent at TVET colleges.

Aviation now flying high in a Gauteng school
More Matshediso
Learners who have aspirations to join the aviation in-
dustry will soon be able to start acquiring suita- ble skills from as early as Grade 10 in Gauteng.
This is made possible by the Gauteng Department of Education as it has launched the Rhodesfield Engineering School of Specialisation with a focus on aviation.
The department’s MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he was pleased to unveil another ground-breaking school of specialisation, which is situated close to the OR Tambo International Airport in Kempton Park.
“The school is one of 29
schools of specialisation, which have been redesigned to address skills shortages to meet the economic demands of Gauteng Cities,” said the MEC.
The school, which was previously known Rhodes- field Technical High School, offers compulsory subjects that include pure mathemat-ics, pure physical science, Engineering, Graphics and Design.
It will soon include aviation to its list.
Some of the subjects that the learners at the school enjoy include Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering (power sys-tems).
The Acting Principal of the school, Ansie Ras, said she was excited about the launch as the school will make a huge contribution to South Africa’s aviation industry.
“We will be able to supply
the aviation industry with learners who are skilled in aviation and who are in a better position to choose ca- reers in aviation,” she said.
“We have partnered with a couple of airlines so that we will be able to take our learn- ers to their technical sites for them to get the experience of the technical aspects of aviation,” she explained.
At the moment the school
teaches about 938 learners from Grade 8 to 12, but it has the capacity to teach about 1 300 learners per year.
Ras said admissions into the school for the Grade 8 class is controlled by the Provincial Department of Education through the online application process.
Applicants have to be good in mathematics and natural science.
Step by step guide on using a face-mask
vukuzenzele unnamed
The National Department of Health recommends that everyone in South Africa should wear a cloth face-mask (also known as a non-medical mask) when in public.
Commuters travelling in taxis and other forms of public transport, as well as people spending time in spaces where physical distancing is difficult to practice, are mustwear cloth face-masks.The main benefit of everyone wearing a face-mask is to reduce the amount of Coronavirus (COVID-19) being coughed up by those with the infection thereby reducing its spread through droplets.Since some people with the Coronavirus may not have symptoms or may not know they are infected, everyone should wear a facemask.Cloth face-mask respiratory hygieneCloth face-masks are recommended as part of respiratory hygiene or etiquette which also includes coughing and sneezing into a bent elbow or a tissue.
The face-mask must cover the nose and mouth completely.
Face-masks should not be lowered when speaking, cough-ing or sneezing.
It is very important that cloth masks are used correctly.
Incorrect use might result in users putting themselves at risk of spreading Covid-19.Even when you are wearing a mask you must still: • wash your hands • observe social distancing • remember to sneeze and cough into your elbow • avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands.The public should not use surgical (medical) or N-95 respirator masks because these are reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.
May 2020 Edition 2How to handle your cloth mask 1.
Only use a mask that has been washed and ironed.2.
Wash your hands before putting the mask on.3.
Place the mask with the correct side facing your face, and ensure that it covers both your nose and mouth properly.4.
Tie the strings behind your head, or if you are using elastic bands, make sure these are tight.5.
Make sure it fits well.
Move it around to get the best fit.
Never touch the cloth part.6.
Once you have put on the mask, DO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE again until you take it off.7.
When you take it off, undo the ties, and carefully fold the mask inside out, hold it by the strings/elastic and place the mask in a container reserved for washing the cloth mask.8.
Wash your hands thoroughly and dry before do ing anything else.9.
You must have at least two cloth masks per person so you will be able to wash one and have a clean one ready for use.10.Masks should be washed with soap and hot water, rinsed thoroughly and ironed.
The importance of social distancing In the battle against the highly infectious COVID-19, social distancing is extremely important to help curb the spread of this disease across the country.Social distancing is about keeping a safe distance of about 2 metres from others so that you reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
This practice is very important while we are in the midst of the coro navirus epidemic where the virus spreads from person to person via an infected person passing droplets through sneezing, coughing or talking.The implementation of social distancing and the lockdown in South Africa is essential in flattening the curve, which is indicated by the number of infected people dropping.
This information was supplied by the Department of Health
Let us unite in our fight against Covid-19
vukuzenzele unnamed
The entire world is in the unrelenting grip of the coronavirus pandemic, whose spread has been rapid.
A vaccine has yet to be found.
Across the world, over 3.4 million people are known to be infected and more than 240,000 have died.
These are indeed desperate times.
When the national state of disaster was declared six weeks ago, South Africa only had 61 confirmed coronavirus infections.
Despite the relatively low number, expert opinion and international experience indicated that infec tions would rise exponentially.
I said that urgent and drastic measures would need to be taken.Those measures – which included a nation-wide lockdown and the closure of our borders – have proved to be effective in delaying the spread of the disease.
This has been possible because most South Africans have adhered to the lockdown provisions, practising social distancing and wearing face masks.
I applaud you for this and for all the other sacrifices you have made.At this stage in the progress of the pandemic, other countries had far more infections than we do.
As of now – which is 46 days since we recorded our 100th coronavirus case – we have 6,783 confirmed cases.
Italy, which has a similar size population to ours, had more than 140,000 cases and the United States had around 700,000 confirmed cases at the 46-day mark.But this does not mean that the danger has passed.
We have not nearly reached the peak of infections in South Africa.
All the scientific models show that the infection rate will continue to rise at a much faster rate in the next few months.However, the speed with which the virus spreads and the number of people who are ultimately infected will be determined by what we do now.
That is why the easing of the lockdown needs to be gradual and cautious.
It is for this reason that many regulations need to remain in place and why it is absolutely essential that people observe them.
I know how difficult this is and I understand the concern that many of our compatriots have about how these regulations are interfering and limiting their rights.
But all this is necessary.
Our overriding objective is the preservation of life.Social distancing and proper hygiene are still our best and only defences in this struggle.
This is what informs the regulations we have put in place for level 4 of our response.
Our considerations are based on empirical evidence, scientific and economic data and international best practice.
In the 1995 judgment of the Constitutional Court that out-lawed capital punishment, Jus tice Arthur Chaskalson wrote: “The rights to life and dignity are the most important of all human rights and the source of all other personal rights.
By committing ourselves to a society founded on the recognition of human rights we are required to value these two rights above all others.”The regulations we have put in place are founded on that commitment to life and dignity, and which justify – in these extreme circumstances – temporary restrictions on other rights, like freedom of movement and association.In doing this, South Africa is not unlike many other countries.An estimated one-fifth of the world’s population is under quarantine or nationwide lockdown, with this number growing rapidly in response to rising infections.
This includes countries with substantially larger populations than ours, like India with its 1.5 billion people.Dozens of countries have imposed curfews such as the one that is now in place here.
Limitations on movement are in place in a number of countries.
In the UK and the French capital, Paris, public exercise is limited to certain hours and within a certain distance of one’s home.Containment and prevention measures similar to ours are in place in a number of countries.
For example, alcohol sales during lockdown have been either restricted or banned in a number of territories and by local governments, including parts of Mexico, Hong Kong and Greenland, which last month imposed a ban on alcohol sales during lockdown to limit infection but also ‘to curb violence against women and children.’There has been much public comment on government’s decision to extend the prohibition on the sale of tobacco products into level 4.
A decision like this is bound to be controversial, but it is wrong to suggest that there are Ministers or a President doing and saying whatever they want on this matter.On 23 April, I announced that cigarette sales would be permitted during level 4.
This was based on the view of the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC), and which was contained in the draft framework that was published for consulation.After careful consideration and discussion, the NCCC reconsidered its position on tobacco.
As a result, the regulations ratified by Cabinet and announced by Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma on 29 April extended the prohibition.This was a collective decision and the public statements by both myself and the Minister were done on behalf of, and mandated by, the collective I lead.Every regulation we have put in place has been carefully considered.
Along the way there has been consultation with medical experts, various constituencies and different industries.
We have been guided by international bodies and the experience of other countries.The reality is that we are sailing in unchartered waters.
There is still a great deal about the epidemiology of the virus that is unknown.
It is better to err on the side of caution than to pay the devastating price of a lapse in judgment in future.
While there are differing views on some of the decisions we have taken – and in some instances these have polarised opinion – government is making every effort to act in a way that advances the rights to life and dignity of all our people.Listening to our people and their concerns during this period has been one of the distinguishing features of how we as government have managed this pandemic.
We continue to listen to the concerns of our people and are prepared to make adjustments that balance people’s concerns about the challenges they face with the need to save lives.At this difficult time, our collective energies must be focused on ensuring that health and life is preserved, that the delivery of food, water, health care, social security and social support is not disrupted.
Under these extraordinary circumstances, as government, as individuals and as society we will at times make mistakes.
When these occur, we will correct them.
But we must carry on, losing neither our nerve nor our resolve.The situation in which we find ourselves demands courage and patience.
It requires goodwill and trust between you, the citizen, and your gov-ernment, and between each other.FROM THE UNION BUILDINGS
3 Vuk’uzenzeleHelp for our vulnerable citizensMany countries around the world have imposed coronavirus lockdowns with a view to saving the lives of their citizens.
We have done the same in our country, but our lockdown has revealed a very sad fault line in our society that reveals how grinding poverty, inequality and unemployment is tearing the fabric of our commu-nities apart.
There can be no greater anguish than that of a parent whose children cry out to them for food, but they have none to give.There can be no greater injus-tice than a society where some live in comfort and plenty, while others struggle at the margins to survive with little or nothing at all.Yes, these are the residual ef-fects of a fractured and unequal past.
But they are also a symp-tom of a fundamental failing in our post-apartheid society.
The nationwide lockdown in response to the coronavirus has gravely exarcerbated a long-standing problem.Over the past few weeks, we have been confronted with distressing images of desper-ate people clamouring for food parcels at distribution centres and of community protests against food shortages.We have also had to contend with allegations both disturb-ing and disgusting.
A number of provinces have received re-ports that callous individuals, some of them allegedly govern-ment oﬃ cials, are hoarding or selling food parcels earmarked for the needy and destitute, or diverting them to their friends and families.If there is found to be sub-stance to these allegations we will deal with the individuals concerned harshly.With the declaration of a na-tional state of disaster and the imposition of a nation-wide lockdown we entered un-charted waters.
South Africa has never had to deal with a public health emergency of this magnitude.We had to act quickly to save lives.
And we must acknowl-edge that in the days and weeks that have followed, the provision of support to our country’s most vulnerable citizens has been slower than required, and that lapses have occurred.However, the payment of social grants has proceeded relatively smoothly, and after a number of technical challeng-es, the food distribution system is being streamlined.Imposing a nationwide lockdown at very short notice presented several challenges.
We have had to weigh up the proportionality of the national response and the extent of restrictions we would need to impose.We ultimately chose to err on the side of caution.
And as the presentation by the Ministry of Health indicated recently, enforcing a lockdown at the time we did has slowed down the rate of infection and, more importantly, bought us time to prepare for a probable surge in infections in the coming weeks and months.We had to consider the impact on an already floundering economy in both the long and short term, and the impact of this substantial disruption on the livelihoods of millions of people.We had to consider what weeks of confinement to the home would mean for the employed not paid regular salaries, for the unemployed and those seeking work, for those in casual or seasonal employment, for those in the informal sector, for the indigent and for the vulnerable.Cabinet will ﬁ nalise a set of measures to respond to the impact of the lockdown on the livelihoods of our people.
This has been preceded by a range of engagements with a number of stakeholders includ-ing business, labour, religious organisations, civil society and the Presidential Economic Ad-visory Council.The social partners have put forward a number of pro-posals on interventions that could address the immediate vulnerability of the poorest of the poor, most of whom rely on social assistance to survive.We will scale up welfare pro-vision during this period to help households living below the poverty line.Even when the nation-wide lockdown is lifted, its eﬀ ects will continue to be felt for some time to come.Those fortunate to have a steady income will be able to return to their jobs; but for millions of others this will be a lost month where they would otherwise have found tempo-rary work, done business in the informal sector or saved money earned to meet their family responsibilities.
Food support is a short-term emergency measure.
It will need to be matched by sus-tainable solutions that help our most vulnerable citizens weather the diﬃ cult times that are still to come.I wish to thank the many NGOs, religious groups and ordinary citizens who are do-nating money and volunteer-ing to help feed the hungry and destitute.Alleviating hunger is not an act of charity.
It is an imperative for any society that is founded on respect for human rights.We are at a point in our bat-tle with the pandemic where complacency could prove disastrous.
I call on each and every one to remain vigilant, to continue to abide by the regulations, and to keep safe and keep others safe.As government we will be providing information on the direct interventions we are taking to shield our most vul-nerable citizens from the grim prospect of starvation.Among the many diﬃ culties our people face at this time, wondering where their next meal will come from should not be one of them.
Traditional leaders key to recovery efforts
Vukuzenzele Unnamed
In the last few months, we have had to bid a sad farewell to two of our country’s most respected traditional monarchs.
The Zulu people recently laid to rest His Majesty King Goodwill Zwelithini ka Bhe-kuzulu who reigned for half a century.
In January, the Ba-pedi people buried Kgoshik-golo Thulare Thulare III, who passed away less than a year after his inauguration.With their passing, we have lost champions of the preservation of our heritage, and revered custodians of the histories of their respective peoples.At the same time, they were vital players in rural develop-ment, and were committed to driving programmes to uplift the material conditions of their people.With the advent of demo-cracy in 1994, it was a prio-rity of the new government to restore the integrity and legitimacy of traditional leadership in line with indi-genous law and customs and subject to the Constitution of the Republic.The institution of traditional leadership continues to play an important role in the lives of millions of people around our country, especially in ru-ral areas.
Traditional leaders support and drive develop-ment in their communities.Recently, I had the op-portunity to participate in the debate on the opening of the National House of Traditional Leaders, which was concerned with the most pressing issues currently fa-cing the country.What was particularly refreshing about the robust engagement was that tradi-tional leadership has a keen appreciation of the difficult economic conditions facing our country, and want to be part of addressing the many challenges of underdevelop-ment and poverty in their areas.
I have consistently said that our economic recovery in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic must be inclusive, and that nobody must be left behind.
The success of the Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan rests on forging strong partnerships between not just government, business and la-bour, but also with traditional leadership and other societal formations.A constant refrain from participants in the debate recently was that they do not want to be dependent on handouts or for their com-munities to perpetually look to government for financial assistance.They want to be provided with the necessary support, training and enabling envi-ronment to allow rural com-munities to be self-sufficient.They want to bridge the urban-rural divide in access to government services and private sector resources.What they would like to see is for rural areas to become centres of economic activity, industry and employment opportunity.
This mirrors the aspirations of the District Development Model (DDM), which was launched in 2019.
Traditional leaders are well positioned to ensure that district plans are informed by and respond to the real needs of communities and that they reflect the lived reality in rural areas.Just as the DDM supports localised programmes that focus on the needs, strengths and opportunities in specific areas, traditional leaders have pioneered their own approach to local economic development.They have developed the InvestRural Masterplan, which was launched in North West last month.
It is greatly encouraging that traditional leaders have rallied behind the plan and want to work with local authorities to en-sure it is a success.During the debate in the National House of Traditio-nal Leaders it was proposed that a major success factor for the InvestRural programme is that traditional structures are trained, strengthened and capacitated.A number of participants outlined economic plans that are already in advanced stages of development.
These range from agricultural pro-jects to bioprospecting to renewable energy.What was evident is that the institution of traditional leadership understands that professionalisation is neces-sary for rural businesses in the form of small, medium and micro enterprises and cooperatives to become part of the mainstream economy.
The traditional leaders who spoke presented their vision of ‘developmental monarchs’, who see themselves as not just custodians of heritage but also as drivers of econo-mic prosperity and progress.
They have identified several projects and economic oppor-tunities that will create jobs and improve livelihoods in rural areas.Traditional leaders have also expressed their willingness to play an active part in the land reform process.
Since 2018, traditional leaders have made around 1 500 000 hectares of communal land available for development, and it is hoped this will increase in future.To develop a coordinated and sustainable strategy, we have agreed to hold a Presi-dential Land Summit in the next year.
This will discuss pressing issues around land reform and its impact on com-munal land, much of which is located in rural areas.The tone of the debate in the National House was a fitting reflection of a climate in which economic recovery is foremost among our consi-derations.
At the same time it was a promising signal that traditional leaders appreci-ate their role in being part of the national recovery effort through being proactive and innovative.The most fitting legacy of great leaders is that the seeds of development they sow during their tenure grow into mighty trees that protect and shelter their communities for posterity.As we work together as a country to rebuild our economy, we will continue to count on the support of the institution of traditional leadership, which is an inex-tricable part of our past, our present and our future.
Help save lives

The Sunflower Fund is calling on South Africans to boost the ethnic diversity of its blood stem cell donor database to save children’s lives.
According to Palesa Mokomele, the Sunflower Fund’s head of marketing and communications, thousands of patients are diagnosed with blood-related diseases every year.
In the past, this diagnosis was often fatal.
Today, a blood stem cell transplant can be a potentially life-sav-ing treatment as it replaces a person’s defective stem cells with healthy ones.
Sadly, many who could benefit from this procedure do not get the treatment they need because finding a donor with a similar tissue type is difficult.
“Patients of colour are at a disadvantage due to the low number of registered donors from black, coloured and Indian population groups,” says Mokomele.
A second chance at lifeZyaan Makda’s (19) world was turned upside down when she was diagnosed with heterozygote haemo-globinopathy, a life-threat ening and incurable blood disorder, in 2007.Her best chance of survival was a blood stem cell donor, but a match couldn’t be found.
As a result, she had to have blood transfusions every two weeks.
“The veins in my hands collapsed and I had a port put in my chest.
I also experienced constant fatigue, had my gallbladder and gall-stones removed and suffered from an underactive thyroid.I was frequently absent from school for medical reasons and could not take part in sports.
Spending long periods of time in hospital was difficult,” she says.Makda’s condition also caused memory loss and seizures and she had to take three years off school.
Despite these challenges, she remained positive.
Makda finally found a donor, but her journey to health was far from over.
